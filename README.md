# Cipher Analysis Examples

This repository now includes simple cipher analysis tools in four languages:

- `python/`: command line utilities for Caesar, Vigenère, and a simplified Enigma simulator.
- `c/`: minimal CLI tool demonstrating Caesar and Vigenère breaking.
- `asm/`: x86-64 assembly program to brute force Caesar.
- `bash/`: shell script performing basic Caesar and Vigenère operations.

Each directory contains a README with usage examples.
