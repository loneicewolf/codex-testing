# codex-testing

This repository contains a minimal LaTeX template for starting a research paper.
The template is aimed at new projects that need a quick setup for academic
writing and reproducibility.

## Files

- `paper.tex` &mdash; Main LaTeX document with typical sections such as
  *Introduction*, *Methodology*, and *Experiments*.
- `references.bib` &mdash; Example BibTeX file for citations.

## Usage

To compile the paper run the following command:

```bash
pdflatex paper.tex
bibtex paper
pdflatex paper.tex
pdflatex paper.tex
```

You will need a LaTeX distribution such as TeX&nbsp;Live or MiKTeX installed.

## Minimal Template

Below is a snippet from `paper.tex` illustrating the structure:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\title{Your Research Title}
\author{Author Name}
\date{\today}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
A brief summary of the paper.
\end{abstract}

% ... more sections ...
\end{document}
```
